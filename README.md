### 🛠️ What This Means
- The repository is essentially a **community fork** of the O11 OTT streamer.  
- It doesn’t include detailed installation instructions in the README itself, but based on similar repos (like `o11-OTT-Streamer`), usage typically involves:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DRMStuff/O11-OTT-v2
  cd O11-OTT-v2
  chmod +x o11v2Free
  ./o11v2Free
  ```
- The tool is intended for experimenting with OTT streaming workflows, especially where DRM (Widevine/PlayReady) might be involved.

### ⚠️ Notes
- The README does not provide support, documentation, or guarantees.  
- It’s a minimal announcement-style README rather than a full guide.  
- For practical use, you’d need to rely on community forums or adapt instructions from related projects like `o11-OTT-Streamer`.
